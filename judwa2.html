    But you've given me twins.
    Time for double celebration.
    Congratulations to you too.
    Doctor, why are there bandages
    on their arms?
    Mr. Malhotra,
    your children were conjoined.
    We had to operate.
    One child is healthy,
    but the other one is a little weak.
    And yes,
    the most important thing.
    Whenever they'd be close to each
    other even after being separated
    their reflexes will also connect
    with each other.
    How?
    - Like..
    If one child cries,
    the other one will cry too.
    If one feels pain,
    the other one will feel it too.

    You mean, when one laughs,
    the other one will laugh too?
    Yes.
    When one jumps,
    the other one will jump too!
    Mr. Malhotra, such cases are
    only one in eight million.
    Wow!

    Raja, what keeps happening to you?
    In the airplane,
    you were doing such antics.
    And while collecting your luggage
    you were acting obscene! - Nandu,
    I wasn't doing it intentionally.
    It felt like someone caught me.
    I don't get it.
    - Hey, Raja.. - Yes?
    I think you're going crazy
    out of happiness.
    Yes, because it's the first time
    I flew in an airplane.
    That's why.. - Welcome to London,
    Mr. Raja, Mr. Nandu.
    How do you know Raja?
    - Well, Pappu Passport sent me.
    Pappu Passport?
    - Yes.
    Pappu Passport insisted that

    My father is sick.
    What's wrong with your father?
    He got hurt and fell.
    A man first falls down

    He fell asleep

    Bam!
    Hey, relax!
    We came here for his treatment.
    Even paid Pappu Passport.
    I sold my kidney for it.
    You sold a kidney?
    - I did.
    I am not worried about the kidney.
    But when my father finds out
    that his son is rotting
    in Dhillon's jail
    my poor sick father won't even
    be able to commit suicide.
    Why? Why not..
    - The fan already fell on him!
    There is no fan!
    - Oh, yes!
    Then how will he hang himself?
    Phone.. Let him talk.
    It's my father calling. My father.
    Will you talk to him?
    - Stop it. You'll make me cry.
    You live in London and make
    fun of the poor like us?
    Lord, there's so much
    sorrow in the world.
    Do you have a handkerchief?
